Scalable URL Shortner Project Requirement
Phase I
Overview
URL shortening is used to create shorter aliases for long URLs. We call these shortened aliases “short links.” Users are redirected to the original URL when they hit these short links. Short links save a lot of space when displayed, printed, messaged, or tweeted. Additionally, users are less likely to mistype shorter URLs.

For example, if we shorten the following URL through TinyURL:

https://babeljs.io/blog/2020/10/15/7.12.0#class-static-blocks-12079httpsgithubcombabelbabelpull12079-12143httpsgithubcombabelbabelpull12143
We would get:

https://tinyurl.com/y4ned4ep
The shortened URL is nearly one-fifth the size of the actual URL.

Some of the use cases for URL shortening is to optimise links shared across users, easy tracking of individual links and sometimes hiding the affiliated original URLs.

If you haven’t used tinyurl.com before, please try creating a new shortened URL and spend some time going through the various options their service offers. This will help you have a little context to the problem we solve through this project.
